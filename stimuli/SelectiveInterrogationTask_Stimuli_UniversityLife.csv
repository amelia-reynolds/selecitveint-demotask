Negative,Assignment Guidelines:<br>Anxious,"One anxiety provoking thing I've found is that some units provide assessment guidelines or marking guides very late It can seem disorganised, but students can receive them only two or three weeks before the assignment is due. Some people find this difficult to cope with - not knowing what to expect or how to start an assignment."
Negative,Online Material:<br>Anxious,The way online material is presented can provoke anxiety in some students. Material is just put online with no thought to organising it or helping students navigate what is its relevance. Students see a lot of material to read but have no idea what to do with it. 
Negative,College Parties:<br>Anxious,"Attending college parties can make some students anxious as they are not always easy to get to. Often parties are held off campus at clubs, bars or other venues. These can be hard to get to and from at night as public transport is not always immediate or close by."
Negative,Group Collaborations:<br>Anxious ,"Something that made me quite anxious about doing collaborative group work was that people rarely met in person. After the initial meeting people often want to chat by email or discuss work online after hours. This does not feel very sociable, but it can be hard to arrange a time to talk face-to-face."
Negative,Academic staff:<br>Appalled,"I think it’s appalling that many people who work as tutors are also students. They probably have no educational qualifications, and they are still studying the subject content themselves. They have little autonomy in the class and merely present information they are given by unit coordinators."
Negative,Campus Facilities :<br>Appalled,"The way some campus facilities are run is quite appalling. Some facilities like the pool, squash courts and gym are only available at odd hours spaced during the day. When they are open, they are often fully booked or booked in advanced so you cannot attend when you want to."
Negative,Meeting Classmates:<br>Appalled,"It is appalling that classrooms are still organised in rows because it makes it hard to talk to new people. You have at most two people next to you, a couple in front and behind you, that is if the room is full. This is not conducive to a social environment for learning. "
Negative,Class Presentations:<br>Apprehensive,"Being assessed based on class presentations often makes students apprehensive about being unfairly assessed. People give presentations as a group, and everyone in a group receives the same mark. So people who do a lot of work, and those who don’t, are treated equally, which can be quite unfair."
Negative,College Parties:<br>Apprehensive,"Many students feel apprehensive about attending college parties, as these often involve alcohol which can make people unpredictable. Many of the activities and games at these party’s centre around drinking, so it’s not uncommon for people to drink more than they intend to. This can adversely affect their behaviour, which makes others hesitance to attend these events. "
Negative,Assignment Guidelines:<br>Apprehensive,"One thing that I am quite apprehensive about at is the way assessment guidelines are written. They often seem deliberately vague and do not give much away in terms of a specific direction to focus your efforts. I know they cannot feed us everything, but I don't know what I don't know when it comes to assignments."
Negative,Group Collaborations:<br>Apprehensive,Working in small groups with other students can make some people apprehensive. Not everyone has the same work ethic or goals with regard to assignment marks as others which can be concerning if one works hard and aims for a high mark. If students are not all aligned with their approach to an assignment it can be challenging.
Negative,Lecture Content:<br>Bored,"I have found I am often bored by the way lecture content is presented. It seems that it does not build on prior knowledge and presents information in an isolated way. This makes it hard to concentrate and integrate what you know with what is taught, so you may switch off."
Negative,Tutorial Discussions:<br>Bored,"Something I find about tutorial discussions are that they can be boring. Often topics are assigned to students several weeks in advance, so you always know what is being discussed each week for the whole semester. There is no spontaneity in discussions as everything is planned out and timed. "
Negative,Campus Facilities :<br>Bored,The campus facilities are dull. It can be quite boring as the campus caters heavily for some activities and less so for others. People who are not interested in the narrow range of things that are catered for in terms of equipment and facilities have to go elsewhere for their activities.
Negative,Meeting Classmates:<br>Bored ,"Meeting people in your classes is pretty boring because cohorts are so segmented. You meet people at your year level, but rarely get to meet people outside your cohort, such as more senior students in classes. In these first-year classes the people can be quite homogenous, as most are school leavers. "
Negative,Online Material:<br>Appalled,The way that online material is presented on our university network is appalling. There is little consistency between the ways that different units present their online material. You never know if you have everything you need for a given week or if new material will be added at some time.
Negative,Social Activities:<br>Disappointed,The social activities are pretty disappointing as many of them are run by the centralised guild. Events are often specific to the study area which means you do not get to meet people from other areas of study. It would be better if more diverse social events were run by independent organisations. 
Negative,Exam Experience:<br>Disappointed,"A very disappointing thing about exam experience at this university is the way exam session are run. Students get 10 minutes of reading time, which is a waste if one wants to get started. Many exams are fixed at two hours regardless of the content because that is just how things are done. "
Negative,Class Presentations:<br>Disappointed,"A disappointing thing I've found about class presentations is that they are so short! When you have several people who have to speak and only ten minutes available in total you cannot get to any detail. So, group presentations lack much scope which doesn’t seem right. "
Negative,Campus Food:<br>Disappointed,"Students looking for nice food can be disappointed by what the limited selection of options available on campus. It is not always easy to find a good variety of nice things to eat. Unless you really know where go, you can end up with a pretty dull diet. "
Negative,Exam Experience:<br>Frustrated,"One of the most frustrating things about University is the inconvenient timing of examinations. These are often scheduled very early in the morning, when traffic makes it difficult to get to campus. Then, when one finally arrives, it can take ages to get parked, which can make students miss the beginning of their exams"
Negative,Administration Assistance:<br>Frustrated,"Dealing with administration when you need help can be very pretty frustrating at times. Administration is centralised, so the people there are not knowledgeable about your area of study or degree which is annoying. Because of this, they can usually only help with small generic problems. "
Negative,Social Activities:<br>Frustrated,Often the social activities organised by the guild or clubs are after hours in the evenings which can be frustrating. Some students do not live close to campus or prefer to study in the evenings. Students may find it hard to attend such events that they would otherwise attend if they were during the day or on weekends.
Negative,Campus Food:<br>Frustrated ,It can be frustrating that many of the campus food and drink venues close early. The guild run cafes close by 4pm so students are left to sit outside to chat after a late class. If students want a late coffee or snack they have to walk to other venues not on campus.
Negative,Tutorial Discussions:<br>Scared,"It’s scary how infrequently tutorials are held. For many units, due to budgetary constraints, tutorials only run once per fortnight or even as few as four times per semester. This can provide inadequate time for discussion and means you are not consistently working through new material."
Negative,Social Spaces:<br>Scared,"Something that scares me about coming from, and going to, some of the social spaces on campus is the fact that poor lighting can make it feel unsafe after dark. The lighting is especially bad around some of the car parks. If you have to walk through these areas by yourself at night it can be quite unnerving. "
Negative,Lecture Content:<br>Scared,I am quite scared that the material taught at university in the lectures does not prepare one for work outside academia. It seems very cantered around theoretical concepts and I'm worried it lacks practical application. How can you get a job with a degree built only on theory?
Negative,Networking Opportunities:<br>Scared,"Going to networking events can be quite scary. You are meeting with professionals working in your field, and these are the people who may end up interviewing you for a job once you have completed your degree. It’s really important to try and make a good impression, so that you do not jeopardise your future employment chances."
Negative,Administration Assistance:<br>Upset,"I discovered one upsetting thing about University is the overly formal way students are treated by administrative staff. We are often treated as a number, not as a person. When you ask for assistance, it is often through an online portal that assigns you a ticket and an unnamed person will get back to you in a few days."
Negative,Networking Opportunities:<br>Upset,"One thing that made me really upset is how infrequently networking events are run. When you are looking for a job after finishing your degree, it can be really important to have made connections with professionals working in the field. It feels like we will be at a real disadvantage with the limited networking opportunities available. "
Negative,Academic Staff:<br>Upset,Something I've noticed about academic staff that is upsetting is that tutors are so constrained in their responses in class. They are often students and can only give answers within the guidelines they are given. Responses are often formulaic and do not explain in sufficient detail which is not good when you want to learn. 
Negative,Social Spaces:<br>Upset,It can be upsetting for students that there are not better social places to meet friends and talk to people as most campus spaces are intended for study. There are few casual places to go with friends. Students wanting to socialise in collaborative workspaces are told to leave which seems silly.   
Positive,Meeting Classmates:<br>Confident,"Students can feel confident about meeting interesting classmates as there are both big lectures with lots of people and smaller tutorial classes. It is easier to talk to new people in tutorials as they are designed for discussion. There is a heavy focus on on-campus learning too, so most students are around some of the time."
Positive,Class Presentations:<br>Confident,Class presentations are a great way to teach students confidence in transferrable skills like public speaking and visual communication. Doing presentations gives students a chance to learn these skills in a supportive environment. This is excellent practice for important skills which are used in real-world employment. 
Positive,Campus Facilities :<br>Confident,Students can always feel confident about their ability to find their way around the various campus facilities here. There are maps on all the buildings and campus maps regularly placed on the paths. There is even an app which can tell you were to go which makes finding everything very straightforward. 
Positive,Assignment Guidelines:<br>Confident,"Students typically feel confident that they will be able to produce appropriate assignments, as the expectations of style and content are set out are set out clearly. Information is made available in advance of the assignments so students can prepare early on. This allows students to feel ready for assignments."
Positive,College Parties:<br>Energised,"The parties at colleges are really energising because the students are so welcoming. The organisers really work hard to be inclusive and make sure everyone is having a good time. There are so many events like these happening regularly on campus, and also in other nearby venues."
Positive,Administration Assistance:<br>Energised,"I always feel energised after receiving whatever administrative assistance I request, as the support provided is fantastic. There is help available for all levels of students, with academic issues, personal issues to financial, college and housing, as well as with special circumstances and assignments. The guild also is wonderful at advocating for students and helping in times of need. "
Positive,Networking Opportunities:<br>Energised,"Going along to networking events always leaves me feeling energised. You get the opportunity to hear about what it is like to actually work in your field, from people with extensive work experience and expertise. I am always ready to study harder after these events!"
Positive,Exam Experience:<br>Energised,"I always feel energised by the provision of practice exams early in semester, as these really stimulate my interest and help me to study effectively.  Giving out these practice exams well before the actual exam is intended to motivate students to study early. This can really help students to perform well in the real exams."
Positive,Networking Opportunities:<br>Engaged,"One thing that students find especially engaging here are the networking events that are held to enable us to meet with professionals working in our fields. Though these are often informal social events, they provide an opportunity to make good connections with prospective employers. Most students find these networking opportunities to be very interesting, and very useful."
Positive,Tutorial Discussions:<br>Engaged,Tutorials can be really engaging as they are designed to provide students with in-depth understanding rather than superficial knowledge. Students get to discuss ideas and concepts in a supportive environment with knowledgeable tutors and their peers. These discussions can be very engrossing and lead to significant mastery of the material.
Positive,Social Activities:<br>Engaged,"The social activities organised by the guild are very engaging. There are many events that involve good music and food, and a lot of work is put into ensuring that the atmosphere enables students to have fun attending these events. They are held regularly though semester so there is always something going on."
Positive,Lecture Content:<br>Engaged,"Lectures at this university are very engaging as they teach you how to question things and formulate your own views, rather than just telling you what to think. Content is often structured around ideas and concepts which are meant to challenge students. This makes content very interesting and aids understanding of material."
Positive,Social Activities:<br>Enthusiastic,"At the start of university life students are right to feel enthusiastic about being part of the social scene here. You are made to feel very welcome and part of a team, whatever group you join or activity you partake in. It is fantastic that you are made to feel that you belong here."
Positive,Academic Staff:<br>Enthusiastic,"The fact that the academic staff here really care about their students, makes us enthusiastic about learning from them. Lecturers and tutors are to be commended for going above and beyond for the students. They often are responsive to student requests and adaptive to the needs of individuals and the class as a whole. "
Positive,Campus Food:<br>Enthusiastic,"It is no surprise that most students are enthusiastic about the eating on campus, and every taste is well catered for at this university.  There are lots of good food places on campus and the range of choices is very impressive. The pricing is competitive and fits most students’ budgets, so everybody can find something they like."
Positive,Class Presentations:<br>Enthusiastic,"Students are generally very enthusiastic about working together to prepare class presentations, and this requires sharing interesting ideas with other students. Working with other students can really improve social skills, improve communication and help to refine understanding. People bring their own experiences to group work, when preparing these presentations, which is fantastic."
Positive,Campus Food:<br>Grateful,"The food available on campus is fantastic. I am so grateful that it provides such an extensive range of options like Chinese, Subway, Vietnamese, Taiwanese, French café food and Turkish kababs. The cafes serve a rotation of foods including Indian, Malay, Japanese and a range of pasta."
Positive,Online Material:<br>Grateful,One thing that students here should feel very grateful for at this university is the amazing quality of the online material and resources. The online experience is so streamlined and works extremely well. Students can find all they need for their units in one place and access them at any time which is something to be thankful for.
Positive,Group Collaborations:<br>Grateful,"Group collaborative work is made so much easier as one can choose the people they work with. I am very grateful for the fact that, as students, we can choose to collaborate with people who share our work ethic to prepare assignment. Many students are thankful of this and make great friends in the process."
Positive,Administration Assistance:<br>Satisfied,"I’ve always had very satisfying experienced whenever I’ve reached out for assistance from those handling administrative matters, as they provide great support to students who need help. This support feels personalised, and they really seem to care for the individual. Students are often glad that administrative assistance is available at flexible times to help when we need it."
Positive,Social Spaces:<br>Grateful,I am very grateful to be on such a beautiful campus with so much space to meet people and sit outside. There are lots of cafes and many open areas to enjoy with friends. Its lovely to spend free time with people by the river too.
Positive,Exam Experience:<br>Satisfied,"Students are generally very satisfied with the exam experience at this university. Student expectations about their exam are set by unit coordinators very early in semester, as are the schedules for exams. It is nice to know in advance how exams will work and what to do to prepare. "
Positive,Social Spaces:<br>Satisfied,It is very satisfying to be able to make good use of the many recreational spaces provided for social gatherings on campus. There are lots of lovely places to meet friends for coffee or sit outside to enjoy the space. Because of the nice ambience in all the green space you never feed crowded. 
Positive,Online Material:<br>Satisfied,"One of the things that ensures high levels of student satisfaction at this university is the provision of excellent online material, that allows flexible study. Students can access the readings for their units at any time which accommodates their study and life commitments. It can be satisfying knowing one can study anytime from anywhere with the online material."
Positive,Campus Facilities:<br>Inspired,"It is inspiring to see the inclusiveness of the campus facilities. This university really makes an effort to cater for everybody, and it’s great that everyone is made to feel welcome. People from all different backgrounds come together here, and everyone belongs, which is wonderful."
Positive,Assignment Guidelines:<br>Inspired,Assignment guidelines inspire students to reflect deeply on their understanding of a topic. This really helps students identify what they already understand well and what areas they should find out more about. This approach to academic guidelines helps students fulfil their potential in terms of marks. 
Positive,Meeting Classmates:<br>Inspired,"One inspiring thing that is great about university is the range of different people one meets in class. There is a fantastic mix of international students from many countries and cultures, as well as domestic students from different backgrounds and regional students. You meet such interesting people in class."
Positive,Tutorial Discussions:<br>Inspired,"It is inspiring that tutorial discussions are designed to train students to become independent and self-reflective in their approach to learning. The content is also designed to ensure that students take a global perspective, and everyone is encouraged to participate in discussion. Our tutorials are so simulating because we discuss big ideas."
Positive,Group Collaborations:<br>Proud,One thing that makes me proud of this university is being able to work with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. International students make up a large proportion of student on campus and they bring their unique experiences to group collaborations. This is a great thing for broadening your social horizons.
Positive,Lecture Content:<br>Proud,"The lecture content often showcases work carried out by researchers at this university, which makes me feel proud to be a student here. You get to see the way in which this work has contributed to new discoveries and has had real-world impact. Students at other universities don’t necessarily get this experience."
Positive,College Parties:<br>Proud,"Students are understandably proud of the great college parties that they have together during semester. People from all across the university are all made to feel welcome and appreciated when attending these parties, which usually are well-organised. It is great to see that everyone is made to feel included at these events. "
Positive,Academic staff:<br>Proud,As a student of this university I feel very proud of the fact that we are being taught by international experts in our fields.
